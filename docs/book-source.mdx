## What are Book Sources?

Simply put, book sources are channels for obtaining books through extensions.

Most readers still primarily read local books, but for certain genres (such as serialized web novels), due to the high intensity of daily updates, local books are not suitable as carriers.

In this case, online book sources come into play. They can collect multiple online book sources and allow local reading, enabling real-time updates to obtain the latest chapters, reducing the difficulty of keeping up with updates, and avoiding readers from having to switch between multiple apps.

Book sources need to be manually written, but I guess most users are not familiar with programming to write book sources. If you enjoy reading online novels, I have a web novel book source written by a "enthusiastic netizen" here:

Reader Copilot provides book source plugins to extend functionality, but it does not provide book source creation services. The book source plugins mentioned in this document are for testing purposes only~

## How to Import?

A book source plugin is a file with the extension `.rcpkg`, and in fact, you can change the extension to `.zip` to view its contents.

Um... it's that simple and straightforward.

Now, go to the settings interface of the application, and you will see a "Book Source Plugin Settings".

Click "Import Book Source Plugin" and select the downloaded `.rcpkg` file to import it.

After importing, you can switch between the existing plugins in the "Book Source Plugin" section.

## How to Use?

A plugin contains one or more book sources. You can go to the "Web Novel Browser" interface, switch between different book sources, browse different information, or search for books.

Clicking on a book entry will take you to the book details, where you can preview chapters in the table of contents. If you think it's okay, you can add it to your bookshelf.
