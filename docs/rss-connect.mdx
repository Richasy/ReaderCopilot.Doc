## Supported Platforms

App supports the following platforms:

- Local (Local Management)
- Google Reader (Platforms that support the Google Reader API protocol, such as [FreshRSS](https://www.freshrss.org))
- [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com)
- [NewsBlur](https://www.newsblur.com)
- [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com)
- [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app)

## Local Management

Local management is the most convenient option as it does not require additional authorization. The app will create an RSS cache in the reading library.

When refreshing the subscription sources, old articles will not be deleted and will be kept indefinitely.

You can achieve cross-device synchronization by placing the reading library in a local cloud drive such as OneDrive.

## Google Reader

Google Reader has been discontinued, but the Google Reader API is still used by various RSS platforms, such as FreshRSS and Inoreader.

Let's take FreshRSS as an example.

<img src={gReaderAuth} width="340px" />

- **Server**: Refers to the Google Reader API address of your deployed FreshRSS service, usually `https://yourFreshRSSdeploymentURL/api/greader.php`
- **Username**: Your registered username in FreshRSS
- **Password**: The corresponding password

Please note that if you are deploying for the first time, you also need to check the "Allow API Access" option in the "Authentication" module of FreshRSS settings.

## Inoreader

Inoreader is an online RSS service provider, which is considered a veteran service with stable quality.

The application inherits the client token for **RSS Track** and has obtained recognition from Inoreader official. It will continue to provide high-quality Inoreader integration services for the Windows platform.

You can switch to Inoreader in the settings, click the `Connect` button, and the application will open a browser. You need to complete the authorization in the browser, and the browser will guide you to open the reading assistant, thus completing the authorization.

After completing the authorization, please close the authorization page in the browser.

## NewsBlur

NewsBlur is also a veteran RSS service provider and provides a comprehensive API interface.

Simply enter your account password to log in and synchronize with NewsBlur.

However, it should be noted that NewsBlur does not provide certain features or the mechanisms may differ from app's existing management mechanisms.

These operations need to be performed in NewsBlur (e.g., deleting groups).

## Feedbin

Feedbin is a relatively new RSS service provider that supports basic RSS reading and subscription source management through its API.

Typically, Feedbin has its own official sources, which are fast and stable.

However, if you have your own deployed Feedbin, you can replace the server with your API address.

## Miniflux

Miniflux is a minimalist self-hosted RSS service.

Similar to [Google Reader](#google-reader), you need to fill in the server address, username, and password.

The application uses the `Basic` authorization method to call the Miniflux service API, so it will locally store your username and password.

## Unsupported Platforms

- [Feedly](https://feedly.com/): Popular, high-quality, and the most comprehensive, but has the strictest API restrictions. App currently does not have the qualifications to apply for an API.
