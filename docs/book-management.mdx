## Changing Book Information

Sometimes, after importing a book, we may not be satisfied with the title/cover. In this case, right-click on the individual book entry and click on the `Properties` option to open the book properties window.

Here, you can change the book cover or modify the title. Once you're done, simply close the dialog box.

The cover supports both local paths and web paths. Web paths only support the `http` or `https` protocols.

## Bookshelf Management

The app provides a bookshelf feature to help you manage your imported books.

You can switch to the bookshelf management interface by clicking on the top-right corner of the bookshelf page, where you can create new bookshelves.

Among them, `Book library` represents the default bookshelf, where all your imported books will be displayed.

When you have multiple bookshelves, you can enter the sorting state by clicking on the sorting button in the bottom-right corner of the interface, and then adjust the order of the bookshelves by clicking on the `↑` or `↓` arrow buttons.

On the bookshelf page, right-click on a book and select `Transfer to Bookshelf` to adjust the classification of the book.
