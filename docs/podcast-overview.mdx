## Features

### Passive Sync

You can set the synchronization interval for podcasts in the settings page. However, even if you set the synchronization interval, you need to open the podcast interface for the synchronization to start, instead of performing background synchronization at a fixed time every day.

### iTunes Search

The app has a built-in podcast exploration module based on the iTunes API, with 17 subcategories. You can also search for podcasts that interest you and subscribe to them.

Since the content displayed may vary in different countries and regions, the app respects the current system's regional settings. In other words, if you are in China, you will not be shown content from the United States.

Of course, you can adjust the current region in the Windows settings by following these steps:

"System Settings" -> "Time and Language" -> "Country or Region", and then adjust it to your desired country or region.

After adjusting the region settings, it is recommended to restart the app.
